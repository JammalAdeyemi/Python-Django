# Create a dictionary called countryMap, where the KEYS are the name of a country (i.e. a string), and the VALUE for each key is the name of that country's capital city.

countryMap = {
'UnitedKingdom': 'London',
'Sweden': 'Stockholm',
'Canada': 'Ottawa'
}
# What does print(countryMap['Sweden']) return? 
print(countryMap['Sweden']) # It returns the value of the key 'Sweden', which is 'Stockholm'.
