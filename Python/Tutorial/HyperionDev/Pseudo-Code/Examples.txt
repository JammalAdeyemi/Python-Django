""" EX 1: write an algorithm that asks a user to input a password, and then stores the password in a variable (the simplest structure we use in coding to store values - you'll learn more about these soon) called password. Subsequently, the algorithm requests input from the user. If the input does not match the password, it stores the incorrect passwords in a list until the correct password is entered, and then prints out the content of the variable "password" (i.e. the right password) and the incorrect passwords:
"""
requests input from the user
store input into variable called "password"
request second input from the user
if the second input is equal to "password"
	print out the "password" and the incorrect inputs (which should be none at this point)
if the second input is not equal to "password"
	request input until it matches the correct password
when second input matches "password"
	print out "password"
	and print out all incorrect inputs
