# 1. An algorithm that asks the user to enter 4 numbers, sorts those numbers from smallest to largest and 
# then prints the sorted numbers.

ask user to input a,b,c,d

# Solution 1
take the first element and compare it with the 2nd element
	if true: swap and increment i by one
	if false: increment i by one
repeat step 2, 3 times

# Solution 2
2. take a,b and compare them; save the maximum as max1 and minimum as min1
3. take c,d andd compare them; save the maximum as max2 and minimum as min2
4. compare max1 and max2 to get the ultimate max value
5. compare min1 and min2 to get the ultimate min value
6. compare the other max in 4 and other min in 5 to get their order
