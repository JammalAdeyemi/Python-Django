# 1. An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called
# first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase "Hello, World".

requests input from the user
store input into variable called "first_name"
store "Hello, World" into variable called "greetings"
concatenate "first_name" and "greetings" using the + method and store into a variable called  "phrase"
print out the variable "phrase"


# 2. An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores their age in a variable called age.   # Subsequently, the algorithm should print out "You're old enough" if the user's age is over or equal to 18, # or print out "Almost there" if the age is equal to or over 16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm   # should print out "You're just too young" if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16.

requests input from the user
store input into variable called "age"
if the users age is greater than or equal to 18
	print out "You're old enough"
elif the users age is greater than or equal to 16  or less than 18
	print out "Almost there"
else the users age is less than 16
	print "You're just too young"
