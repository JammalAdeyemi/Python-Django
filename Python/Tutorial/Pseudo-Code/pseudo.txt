# 1. An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero values, then
# determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.

a. Ask the user to enter a number.
b. if the number is 0 or negative, exit/break.
c. save the number as an integer.
d. If this is the first number weâ€™ve seen remember it as the new maximum.
e. go to step a.
f. If the new number is larger than our current maximum, remember it as the new maximum.

# 2. An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

get the arbitrary number of integers
converts to integer
get the total summation
get the total length/count of numbers
divide the summation by length/count
print the average
